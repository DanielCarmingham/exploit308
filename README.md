Experiment to exploit 308 redirects for fingerprinting users

## Running

This runs a nodejs server to experiment with using 308 redirects to persist fingerprinting of users in the browsers 308 URL cache.

Initialize via `npm install`.

Start via `npm run start:dev` to run using nodemon for dev.

Point your browser to `http://localhost:8000/` and watch the console log.  

Note the difference when doing a refresh vs a hard-refresh. 

In my experimentation, a hard refresh caused the 308 redirect to refresh, which caused the fingerprinted URL to get lost.
